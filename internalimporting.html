        To get my 3d model on blender onto my website took many steps. The first thing I had to was to upload the blender onto a website called sketchfab. After exporting to this sit I could publish online and from there the website gives you the code to embed it into your website. As the code from the site doesn't give you seperate css and html code I had to seperate the css and html code by hand. Evidence of this technique can be found in my documentation.
