        On this page i am going to talk about the process of making my website and little bit on my 3d model.
        <br> To make my website I used a program called brackets that our teacher introduced to us. Then learning how to code on basic level and some practice, I created 3 new html files known as internal.html, internalimporting.html, and internalprocess.html. Along with some css style sheet called internal.css. These files are my 3 pages on my website respectively and I linked them all to my css file. From there I started to lay down basic html skeletons to begin coding. First i to get a legal navigation bar off W3schools as i didn't have the coding ability to do this my self. Then I added a title and replicated the nav bar and title across my pages. From there the only big struggle was to embed my model into my website from sketchfab which is talked about in the importing page. The rest is all just small techniques discussed in my documentation. As well as filling out the page with text and images.
