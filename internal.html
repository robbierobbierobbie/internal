        The program that I will be using to create my 3d model will be Blender. Blender is a free PC program used for many things such as 3d modelling and animation for all skill levels, beginner to veteran. In my case as a beginner this program did start out a little beginner unfriendly as there is no guide. When i got started I did a quick search into google and found a helpful youtube video by "Blender Guru", to teach me the very basics.
